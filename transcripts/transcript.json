You can feel your legs doing their work underneath you. It's so slow. Again, ringing off the inside of your helm, your own breath. Sweat pouring down your brow. Ahead of you, the shape comes into focus from blur into three swimming shapes that you realize are the same wall. It's a wall, it's a building. There's something happening. There's fire. There's an orange glow that has turned the white marble of your city into a hellscape. (crackling electricity) There is a burst of energy, an explosion. It moves so fast out to a radius of 10, 15, 20 feet and then joins the glass time that you are in. (expansion) (gasps) Slow.

Could have been a street you walked on the first time you came to this city. At the end, there's an open plaza. You know at the center of that plaza there's supposed to be a statue. You know who that statue is of. Instead there is open space. You see a boy, five years old, a red shock of hair. He sits with his feet dangling in the opening.

You're moving under the power of your own body and you feel your sense and your memory returned to you. You catch your breath. And, once again, that sound does not sound like a stranger to you.

That veil becomes so thin that incredible workings of magic are possible. Now, you knew that an Apogee Solstice was coming, but the Grand Geometer specifically reads leylines, because it's been recorded in the history of Avalir, your city, your home, that some Apogee Solstices are powerful enough to shift leylines, to take the arteries and veins of the magical workings of this world and reshape them. You, reading the ancient lore of Avalir, were able to build the Grand Geometer to measure the strength of a coming Apogee Solstice. Based on your records, based on effectively arcane psychometry, and the ability to read the power of other Celestial Solstices from runes and holy sites in your travels all over the world. Avalir, as you know, travels on the leylines of Exandria, flying all over, trading with a host of cities and civilizations. You were able to deduce that anything above a reading of 0.025 on the Grand Geometer would indicate that there would be some slight shifting of the leylines. 0.025. You're reading 0.5."

You're talking about really, really rare stuff even in the Age of Arcanum. This doesn't have that pattern to it.

She has a long collared breasted coat over top that stretches down like a gown, in an emerald green that almost has its own silken sheen to it with a teal blue, indigo, name your color dress, depending on how it hits the light underneath. In her hair, she has this almost like a sun ray fascinator made of gold, where pieces of her hair are falling through it. Around her neck is a rigid golden ring. If you look closely at it, it has tiny blue crystals like tiny Swarovskis that are brumestone, and it lightly levitates and rotates and spins around her at all times, as well as a orb, a glowing orb that is her focus that also just hovers, almost celestial, planetary in nature. She looks as if the outfit was made for her this morning (whispers) because it probably was.\n\n(laughter)"

Patia, you are here to meet Loras of the Weaver's Mask, a member of the Ring of Gold. Those 14 wizards, apprentices of the Septarion, who command respect, second only to the seven archmages that rule the city itself. Loras of the Weaver's Mask commands respect and status by virtue of being an apprentice to one of these archmages. You come here to meet him on the day of the Replenishing here in the Archsept, one of the few people who even is allowed to walk within this place. This is a magocratic society. This is not open to the public, but you are not the public. As Keeper of Scrolls, you find yourself welcome here, but of course, not every Keeper of the Scrolls has been. No. That position has an extra meaning in subtle and clever hands. The door opens, Loras steps out and is accompanied by a second figure.

The arcane power commanded by Loras is overshadowed by almost no one, with the exception of Eldamir the Wise. Eldamir has sat on the council since the beginning of Avalir. It is rare to see an ancient elf, but you see, slightly bowed with age, wearing a shimmering golden cloak that appears to offer little glimmering crystals of golden light that shimmer in geometric shapes and turn into motes and float away, a face illuminated by its own wisdom and counsel.

This is the last day before the city of Avalir will land and make good on its ancient pacts by releasing its store of ether, of raw magical energy, back into the lands of Domunas, to replenish that continent and make good the promise to the druids of Old Toramunda that a new age will come, an age of flourishing, of magic. In the year following a Replenishment, crops explode throughout the land, and often, a generation of magical children will be born and there will be a revitalizing. The fey will flourish and doors to lands of wonder and plenty and magic will open. The Replenishment is such an important time for the many cultures of Domunas. For many days now, that continent, you've seen fireworks going up. As you approach Cathmoíra, you see all the villages and towns surrounding it send up fireworks, kites flying. As you approach Cathmoíra, you begin to hear it. You are now close enough as the sun lowers off the western edge of the city, the choirs of Cathmoíra singing far off, but even here above the clouds, you hear the distant but palpable songs of welcoming, a return home. A month of rest and repair on arcane infrastructure and all manner of civic defenses and technology, but also return home in a spiritual way, in an emotional way, a return to the earth. The release of magical energy and a reuniting of the mountain that once was a very historically significant mountain. As the sun sets, shadows grow long. As the sun sets, shadows grow long, and you find yourselves hearing festivities and the Parade of Beasts begins, and you can hear revelry all throughout the city.

This is a text from when the Primordials-- So there's a lot of stuff about the Schism in the Librarium Incantatum, right? Because the founding of Toramunda has its root in the Schism, right? The Toramunda was founded when the Emperor of Fire and the Empress of Earth that were two mighty Primordials were laid low and sealed forever away by the Dawnfather under Mount Ygora. It was in the guise of that mountain that eventually the druids of Gau Drashari came and built Toramunda, tending to this holy place. Over time, those druids tended to it so well that other people came and sought them out. Then eventually it grew into a city and that city eventually attracted wizards. Those wizards eventually took the top of that mountain and sailed away. But the name Ghor Dranas from the early Schism, because in the Schism, there were dragons fighting on behalf of the Prime Deities, there was a threat made in the epics of one of these battles during the Schism by the Betrayer Gods. It's attributed to different ones in different texts, but the text that at least-- Well, who knows reliable, but the most detailed text that you remember from your encyclopedic knowledge of all of the scrolls of your library and all the tomes therein is that it's often attributed to the Lord of the Hells. Ghor Dranas is, it's just a very specific wording that he said in the battle of his defeat in the Schism when he was sealed away, where he said like, \"Put me where you will.

You look at this thing and realize it was shattered. In your head, you immediately go to Mage's Disjunction, 9th-level spell something that could have destroyed that. You look and look and look at this. You know how to look for the residue of a spell. This, first of all, the bow of a solar could not be dispelled by mortal mage. Not only that, you think that this wasn't a spell. Something deeper and older and more profound than a spell happened. You know for a fact that nothing Vespin Chloras did or ever could have done, could have done what happened to this. So the question that your mind immediately goes to is: Vespin didn't do this, so who did? Because when he tried whatever he tried, perhaps very quickly, there was someone or something else in the room with him, and its mere presence took the weapon of one of the heaven's mightiest warriors and shattered it without effort."

It's easy to get, even very junior mages can master it. The problem with invisibility is light is very important for a number of functions. No matter how cloaked you might be in it, you can't make your whole self invisible. Even if it's smaller than a pin prick, you need just enough of your eyes to stay visible that light can hit them and you can still see. Now, perceiving a fraction of a pupil hanging in space, smaller than a grain of sand, would be beyond most people, but you've been trained to look for them because they always move in two."
