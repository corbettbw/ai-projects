right i feel like most peopl most peopl would uh probabl sai middl school is where thing start to get realli lord of the fli and for some reason i just caught hell in third and fourth grade in elementari school you know uh get beat up i got put in a trash can uh you know it wa a bad it wa a bad look at that time and you know i for you know i look you know you you don ' t want to look back and sai like oh i had it come but i can look back and sai like thing thing these thing ar not excus so thei don ' t have excus but thei do have explan right you know what i mean like recess would start and i ' d take a big old red wall book and i would not run to the jungl gym i would go sit under a tree and read my red wall book and that made some kid feel some type of wai and thei need to express that um not through the majesti of languag but uh through a more uh direct mean um so i got bulli pretti badli um and it wa begin to affect my my tempera you know my mom talk about like see sort of see the light go out of your ey a littl bit right like um your your enough exposur stuff like that and you ' l l start it ' l l start to have an effect on you um so i got taken out of school for for that reason and i had known other kid that at home like my brother my stepbroth had um homeschool for a year and then come back to public school and then homeschool again there ' s a lot of homeschool kid in the area so you know homeschool also mean veri differ thing cultur realli like if you ar a super religi homeschool it ' s a veri differ vibe than like you ' r e a veri true like a hippi homeschool so we were like upstat new york hippi homeschool it wa like a lot of you know um there were a lot of kid in that homeschool network so when i start homeschool there were you know i wa see like a dozen or more other kid everi week like multipl time a week there wa like a homeschool soccer leagu and there wa a home school like my friend johnni germani ' s dad taught like a civic

camp um agt later call later anoth camp call the wayfind experi start um so that wa a big moment of like discov ident there and it wa much better for me you know the um you know all kid ar differ right all peopl ar differ peopl have differ educ need for myself and my brother we had enough intern drive that mostli the structur of formal school at that point were impedi you know what i mean like like you know there were multipl time when i wa in class with my brother where we would like finish a book and tell the teacher like hei we ' r e finish and the teacher would be like okai close the book and keep your hand on your desk and look straight ahead and you ' r e like oh i can ' t can i go do anoth activ and thei ' r e like don ' t be a distract and you go ah well shit um you know like
