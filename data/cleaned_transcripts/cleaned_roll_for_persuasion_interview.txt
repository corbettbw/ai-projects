BRENNAN: what's going on dude my man thank you so much for having me on the show a delight uh to be here in such as you were saying esteemed company uh uh you have had so many of me i was looking through uh the show roster and it was just a little gasp after a little gas with oh that person is great oh that person is great and that person's great uh a lot of great people on the pod 

INTERVIEWER: well thank you it's you know what it's been it's been an interesting thing the whole naming of the show which is a little on the nose but it was like i don't know anybody in gaming or tabletop or entertainment or movies or whatever uh and it's gonna take a high persuasion role to get these people on the show but what i found is you get one then the next person goes i know that person and then you know and then somehow we end up here and we're chatting and it's going to be a lovely time 

BRENNAN: how about it 

INTERVIEWER: they teach you i hear because i could not afford the entrance fee but they teach you an interview school um that you should ask direct yet open-ended questions kind of lead the conversation and you know help shape the narrative that you're going with but i'm throwing that out the window because i just really want to know how did somebody get from uh growing up homeschooled to who wants to be a millionaire to applebee's commercials to college humor to one of the most popular and successful tabletop french are you a franchise i don't even know what to say anymore with dimension 20. 

BRENNAN: theoretically we're an anthology show i like to think of us as the show feels the most straightforward it's a show it's on a platform boy listen the the circuitousness of the root is certainly not lost on me either boy that applebee's commercial that was a rough day the that was a really rough day we were shot in times square and i had to literally sprint across so bad with like big trays of these like weird ice cold varnished onion rings uh because you know it's all food prep so it's all they're all made to look right tasty but they're not really tasty they've been covered in plastic and chemicals and stuff boy that was a crazy day and then kept making me improvised stuff and at one point i forgetting that applebee's commercial i was supposed to come in like we're here in times square talking to real people and what they want to eat and they think they're going to get a five star and i just did it so and they kept being like okay doing a little different this time a little bit different this time and i came out in one of the takes and went we're here in the beating heart of the capitalist west trying to get some corporate food down the gullets of these unsuspecting strangers and they were like that don't don't do that again and i was like i'm so sorry please give me my three hundred dollar sword whatever whatever new media rate there was for that day right yeah it was a wild coming up from homeschooling going through it it's so bizarre like like i think what's so weird looking back on everything and like how we got the dimension 20 from from these other places i think the the weird thing about it is that i was anticipating life being more circuitous and it actually wasn't in this case that's the weird thing right like i'm here in my 30s playing my favorite game that i was playing when i was 10. and when you're a 10 year old you have like i wish i hope i played d and d every day for the rest of my life and some monkeys pause somewhere you know popped off and made that happen so it's so sort of bizarre it's like it is a true blessing and a weird it just it just profound good fortune uh to be able to do this professionally it's crazy 

INTERVIEWER: that's fantastic and i think that's almost a common thread i feel like with many people i talk to whether in tabletop or acting or performing just the unexpected turns that get you to where you're going and looking back and going i i had no idea that i would actually this thing i said when i was 10 i would love to do this forever actually getting to do that um it's kind of mind-blowing and of course there are things that you do to set yourself up for success and be able to take advantage of the opportunities that come to you and you know many of us are born with various amounts of privilege that help get us to where they are but um there is that common thread of like a passion or a thing you love you know coming back around and being a thing that you are able to do later in life that maybe you didn't think was gonna be a career option right 

BRENNAN: right well who could have predicted right prior to the adventure zone prior to critical role it was so obvious that there was no space within media for this to be a storytelling format that would that you could profit off of right um it would be enough to sustain doing it at a pace and frequency to actually make it a show that people would enjoy supporting yeah it's it's just it's just cartoonish i remember there was this one weird foreshadowing moment a couple years prior to starting dimension so like i was aware of critical role i was aware of the adventure zone right i was watching them i was consuming them it was like oh these are great but not that's not that's never going to happen for me uh and i was running a game in my old apartment where i was with my roommate prior to moving in with my fiance so this was you know 2016 i want to say something like that and i'm playing with my friends we're on this living room and my roommate and his two friends come home and they're not d people but they know that we're playing the whole weekend and so you know we're in the living room going at it and these guys come in with a big bunch of food right so they kind of have to sit at the table that's like adjacent to the living room couch area where we are and it's like hey we're all friendly so it's fine they start eating their dinner while we're playing there's a momentary awkwardness of like oh no strangers are going to watch us pretend um but as it goes along they the people eating dinner my roommate and his two friends sort of quiet down and start really looking at us as we're playing they sort of eat the food and then they sort of like turn their chairs to face us as we're playing and then we continue going and then they sort of finish their meal and they stay there for a while and then one of them comes over in like a little we take a little bathroom break and one of them who's not even my roommate the person that's like i've never really met before comes over and is like is it okay if i just like get a blanket and some pillows and just chill out in the corner i promise i won't bug you guys at all i just wanna watch i just wanna just wanna watch and the the i was like are you sure you know in my head i was like oh are you sure like this is just our little game we're doing and yeah and the guy was like so do like do you guys know what's gonna happen and i was like no no we're we're rolling we're finding out and it's like you're so you're making this up and it's like yeah yeah we are sort of sort of you know there's some stuff that that there are certain things that are you know structurally in place beforehand but yes it's being discovered in the moment and he was like i i i don't know how to say this i have to see how it ends like i can't i'm invested i've only been listening for 30 minutes i have to i have to know what happens um and that was such a weird and then like you know less than a year later i was like making dimension 20. and it was this weird moment of me being like seeing up close like oh there is something about this medium that does work it is captivating you can't like even for all the people that are like you know what two hour episodes or whatever like even for all those people there is just there is a group of people that is larger than anyone could have anticipated that sees this format of storytelling and goes i can't look away i'm totally captivated by what i'm seeing 

INTERVIEWER: what did that pitch kind of look like like when did that start becoming an idea of like hey let's formulate a show we wanted to have this this sort of format we want to play with this style versus your critical role or whatever how did that kind of coalesce 

BRENNAN: it was crazy we had a i had just been hired a college humor full-time i had applied to work there didn't get the job and ended up coming in part-time as the question writer for him actually so i was writing nerdy questions from actually so at that point i was playing a home game with brian murphy emily oxford javon thompson zakoyama i was playing another home game with lou wilson and a bunch of lose friends and i had met matt mercer and like amy warple and a bunch of other people that would be like an early side quest as a question writer from actually uh so like of meeting people but so i they were saying like we need more long-form content for dropout like we need more longer-form stuff for our platform we can't just be three-minute sketches so i'm sitting there writing a treatment for an actual play and even that like i had gone to the last bookstore in los angeles and bought all the five e-books for the first time i was like researching stuff i i was creating this market research document that was like here's what here's the adventure zone and critical role and here's why they're brilliant and here's what works about them right here's other sort of things in the space and and things that i think could could work better about what they're doing um here's the limitations imposed on us by being a paywall protected platform and here's how we lean into that right okay we can't stream live because we're a plat we're a paywall platform so how do we lean into not being able to be live we get the best set designer in the world that's rick perry we get beautiful shots by michael shaw buck and dps like santi and everyone else like we we dive in santiago bazi our dp like we lean into that direction so making that document and before i'm halfway done with it i get called into our head of development's office adam fruchi who goes hey man forget whatever you're doing right now how would you feel about running an actual play show and i go look oh my god actually i'm actually going to talk about um actually yeah i got it right here put my laptop around um so it was just in the zeitgeist it was already sort of there and then you know everything came around through you know it being anthology and getting this cast together our first what's our first season gonna be you know all this stuff um and it it took off but it was it was yeah that was that was an other worldly i was like 29 i think and that happens is like you know almost like four and a half years ago and it was like i was in a mountain of medical debt all had all my credit cards maxed out i was like broke improv teacher living in los angeles and you know i had i was like i was like oh this is i got to la and didn't get the college humor job at first and then all in the span of a very short amount of time it was suddenly like oh not only am i a college humor cast member which i was like watch i was watching jake and amir videos when i was like 17 years old in college but now i'm making a d show the thing i've been doing the the thing i had the most practice doing of anything sure yeah the thing i have like my 10 000 hours have been in there for years now uh and you would be a fool not to just walk through life in a kind of bewildered state of gratitude which is the only vibe i feel from the moment from just all day just like i cannot believe uh uh the good fortune the the bizarre strokes of good luck uh that needed to happen to make this a reality unbelievable 

INTERVIEWER: what's been like the most surprising of the last like four years um as you've been going through this journey of i mean because now dimension 20 is put out i countless of those those anthologies like those those seasons right um was it the initial like response from fans and you know the the enjoyment of the content you were putting out or there's something else just been like holy i can't believe 

BRENNAN: it's all been overwhelming like the the process has been so wild in terms of finding you know the chemistry of that core cast the incredible hard work of our crew and all the people that work on the show to make it a reality from from producers and designers all the way down through all our technical departments and camera and sound and all the way you know and our pas and every everyone who's working that show has always been like a dream to work with and um and then all the amazing guests and people you know the luminaries in the community that are coming for side quests and allowed us to like you know the mcelroys and people that like i've been listening to for years and suddenly they're sitting at your table and you're running a game for them it's like it it's unreal and like you're saying you know it's this for anyone that listens or watches you know the it's it's something it's something that there's there's not always a great platform or like spotlight to be able to communicate but if there's anyone out there who has like supported the show signed up for dropout even like what watched our stuff on youtube like if you if you have engaged with our content in a meaningful way like i and oh a huge amount of the people that i love most dearly in this world owe you our entire ability to do this for it's like it's hard to communicate the gratitude i feel towards fans of the show because that's obviously the metric that that kept dimension 20 going like you know college humor went through a big collapse and it was a very sad it was a really heartbreaking time and the only reason that sort of dimension 20 was able to crawl out of the rubble was is due to the fact that there was this huge amount of fan support for that show so in a real way you know like if i i wish i had the the time in my life to be able to thank each and every person individually because they all do play a part in why we are able to do this it's it's it's if i think about it too much i'll freak out it's too nice it's the i know people are not watching the show as a personal favor to me but it is the it has improved the quality of my life beyond what i had dreamed would be possible so i do i do say thank you 

INTERVIEWER: i think that's such an interesting point because um for so many people in our various jobs like i for instance my day job is in marketing um and which ends up being a lot of like numbers and metrics and you know i'm grateful for my job and how it pays the bills but i very rarely have that direct connect the idea of oh somebody purchased x that was a thing i did a campaign on my campaign influenced them to purchase the thing like i can directly say thank you to this it all kind of starts to get lost the more steps of separation you have but in content creation like the the consumer is so immediate right like there's that awareness when when you see half a million downloads a million dollars whatever it might be every single one of those is a person right like you're saying it's a person who made the choice to spend time with you to invest financially in you and then when you when you pay your mortgage or you you buy an engagement ring or something you're like this is happening because i know a million people said i want to watch this or i want to put money that is kind of a it's a bit of a mindfuck in a good way 

BRENNAN: yeah of course i mean but you you i think you have to move from that place of gratitude right because the work can be really really hard you know like it's long hours we've made 14 seasons of the show in four years you know that's a lot of that's a lot of late nights that's a lot of elbow grease that's a lot of like missed social functions and family functions but i don't know i i had a friend recently who was talking to me you know and just it was something like phrased it in a way of like forget and like in terms of metrics of success right if you are making art that you believe in and it is connecting with an audience who who appreciates it and you for truly what it is you i could you could fly to the moon and back on that energy right and if and if that can actually put food on the table then it's an embarrassment of riches then it's it's like you know like oh my god i expressed myself it connected with somebody and i could buy a burrito because of it if that doesn't floor you with just like the utmost gratitude i don't know i don't know how else you can move through the world it's it's yeah it's staggering it's really staggering 

INTERVIEWER: that's fantastic i do want to take you back play the little you know flashback musical cue um and and this is a selfish question but it's my show so i get to ask those uh i mentioned at the top you you you mentioned to me briefly once on a word call before something like the one time we spoke um you were homeschooled uh and this is always interesting to me because i was homeschooled and it's just a it's a fascinating thing for me to talk about with people particularly people who are in entertainment or audience facing careers because i think i don't think i know that like homeschooling in general has this stigma or this idea or this concept that is oftentimes actually true of like the sheltered unengaged didn't have any friends but all this different stuff and um i know that from my own experience to to not be a completely accurate generalization but i'm always curious what other people's experiences were like growing up in in a world of homeschooling like like what were your thoughts about it how did it impact where you got today like it's such a fascinating discussion to me and uh and i don't get to meet too many people in the wild who are like oh yeah this is how i was educated and here's how it impacted my whole life 

BRENNAN: well number one i've never been cool a day in my life so at a certain point you just double down on the strategy you just lean in lean into the skit oh i'm homeschooled i i i got a bunch of wizard costumes that i i wear a cape a lot like let's just lean in you know it's not gonna get easier it's it's that sort of thing of like the um i don't know why my mind went here of all places but there was there's a scene in the wire where the a guy's gotten caught for murder and he's going to go away for life so he just starts confessing to all these murders that he didn't even commit because he realizes that by confessing to them he will prevent his other friends and his criminal organization from getting caught for those murders like i'm already going away forever might as well just say i did them all you know yeah uh so that's a truly bizarre analogy but it's like hey i'm already homeschooled and wearing a cape let's play d d you know like it's not it's not going to get better from here let's go to school for philosophy when we're 14. let's write games for larp camp what you know like what are they going to do call you a nerd 10 times as loud they're already screaming nerd at you like let's just let's just keep it moving so i got pretty ferociously bullied in elementary school which is a little weird it's a little bit earlier than a lot of sure a lot of people catch that that intensity of bullying right i feel like most people most people would uh probably say middle school is where things start to get really lord of the flies and for some reason i just caught hell in third and fourth grade in elementary school you know uh getting beat up i got put in a trash can uh you know it was a bad it was a bad look at that time and you know i for you know i looking you know you you don't want to look back and say like oh i had it coming but i can look back and say like things things these things are not excusable so they don't have excuses but they do have explanations right you know what i mean like recess would start and i'd take a big old red wall book and i would not run to the jungle gym i would go sit under a tree and read my red wall book and that made some kids feel some type of way and they needed to express that um not through the majesty of language but uh through a more uh direct means um so i got bullied pretty badly um and it was beginning to affect my my temperament you know my mom talked about like seeing sort of seeing the light go out of your eyes a little bit right like um your your enough exposure stuff like that and you'll start it'll start to have an effect on you um so i got taken out of school for for that reason and i had known other kids that at home like my brother my stepbrother had um homeschooled for a year and then come back to public school and then homeschooled again there's a lot of homeschool kids in the area so you know homeschooling also means very different things culture really like if you are a super religious homeschooler it's a very different vibe than like you're a very true like a hippie homeschooler so we were like upstate new york hippie homeschoolers it was like a lot of you know um there were a lot of kids in that homeschooler network so when i started homeschooling there were you know i was seeing like a dozen or more other kids every week like multiple times a week there was like a homeschool soccer league and there was a home school like my friend johnny germany's dad taught like a civics class uh you know my my uh uh stepbrother's mom uh taught a writing like a writing workshop you know there was like a lot of fun fun stuff that happened there um and uh it was really positive it was a really positive experience um that was also during the time in my life so that you know from like 10 to 14 i was homeschooling and that's also when i started playing d d and it's also when i started going to uh larp camp this camp um agt later called later another camp called the wayfinder experience started um so that was a big moment of like discovering identity there and it was much better for me you know the um you know all kids are different right all people are different people have different educational needs for myself and my brother we had enough internal drive that mostly the structures of formal school at that point were impediments you know what i mean like like you know there were multiple times when i was in class with my brother where we would like finish a book and tell the teacher like hey we're finished and the teacher would be like okay close the book and keep your hands on your desk and look straight ahead and you're like oh i can't can i go do another activity and they're like don't be a distraction and you go ah well shit um you know like you feel like you're in trouble right um so homeschooling you know was this incredible opportunity to and again also a tremendous privilege right like my mom was a writer and worked from home and my pop as a musician he had gigs so there would always be like one parent around and we also like you know i don't homeschooling a 10 year old is very different than homeschooling the six-year-old i don't know what life would have been like if we had been homeschooled when we were really really little right that would have been a way bigger uh uh i think challenge right um but but by the time we were doing that my mom had gotten these core curriculum books that were really awesome we remember the first year of homeschooling we got to do cool educational stuff my mom was just like okay year one you guys have learned a garbled version of history you know i was like 10 years old and i was like england and europe are two names for the same place because i've only learned about the american revolution right it's like oh we got to start and my mom was also like how the hell are you not going to start at the beginning like you can't start with america that's it's gibberish like how do you what would that even be so we spent a whole year with like we had a we did some math and some spanish but mostly it was just history that's just a whole year from 10 to 11 studying history from the beginning of time being literally like physics like the earliest history is physics how did the universe start and then going through and that was like it was really cool to not have this day where you're constantly shifting a school day where you're constantly shifting gears and to instead have something where it's like oh this whole year we're just in the mindset of the history of the world yeah it's pretty like it's weird 

INTERVIEWER: that's actually very similar to what we did growing up that like 

BRENNAN: oh cool 

INTERVIEWER: like starting you know history of usborne's history of the world the book that we worked through um because and i never had the public school you know thing to hold it up against and see what the difference was but it just intuitively made sense to me especially once we got to because in texas even if you're homeschooled you have to take two years of texas history um which is just a lot of massacres i mean there's so many and you lose track of them but like having to like you know hit the brakes and then do like this very out of context thing it was hyper focused without like historical context um yeah it was a very i had a very similar experience at least from the approach there and so yeah i appreciated it it's funny that you you mentioned and point out that there are really kind of like two schools very general schools there's the religious homeschool world and then there is the you know for black bear term like the more the more hippie home school um because i grew up in the south obviously in a very religious homeschool setting and now i've got a three-year-old daughter who we're raising in a very hippie homeschool setting yeah it's interesting hearing you talk about discovering some of those nerdy loves early and being able to embrace and lean into them because at least in my context um it was very it was it's a very strange time in the south especially in the 90s because it was very reactive coming out of satanic panic and like you know hey you're a young kid and you love like red wall one of my first fantasy loves i'm cool you can read tolkien and you could read narnia because they're secretly about jesus but you can't read anything else because they're about satan and so there was this constant like well this doesn't make sense because it's all fantasy and magic and they're beheading things and they're setting things on fire and that's okay but over here it's not um you know the first year harry potter came out it's great but the second year it's the devil um that dissonance as a kid was very very distracting i guess from kind of what you're talking about kind of discovering parts of yourself early on um so it's encouraging as a parent who's trying to raise a kid more similar to kind of what you're talking about that you know there's some there's some benefits and provides some some good roads to be who you want to be 

BRENNAN: yeah i mean that's sort of the wild thing right is that like i know have so many friends like yourself who had to uh fight for their self-expression against the circumstances of their upbringing right and i think we all need time for for for a million reasons not just for nerdy reasons but my god for things that are you know life or death the ability to like all of my lgbtq friends that you know you're you're like rebelling against that pro you know of the of the list of like totally unearned blessings i've had in my life i would say the fact that like my self-expression was completely in some ways i'm like one of the most traditionalist people i know like i grew up with like you know the carmina godelica like a glossary of fallen angels and weird celtic hymns and myths you know like up on the wall of my home but in a weird way i am completely predictably the son of my parents my mom is a comic book writer and like science fiction author my dad's a stand-up comedian it's like i am always a little bit bashful for i would say the majority of people i know that are in this hobby industry had to throw some elbows and childhood had to find a way to secretly get their hands you know like one way or another and and even if your parents were not actively you know like like you know uh uh zealously trying to prevent you getting that stuff it's also hard enough if they just don't get it 

INTERVIEWER: totally yeah 

BRENNAN: you know like even even that which is like you know less of an obstacle than active opposition but still like oh my parents don't really get it or don't really support it my mom is the person who suggested i start playing d and d she put up a notice in our local game store october country new falls like um so that's that is a uh you know in in some sometimes i've joked about my career as being like i'm kind of opening the family store every day like i'm in this space of like artists and bohemians but weirdly temperamentally i'm like the kid who is staying in the hometown and like running the family's you know business because of who my parents were but yeah it's you're absolutely right it's a very it's bizarre to or not bizarre but i guess it is profound uh how fortunate i am to have had the parents that i had who not only did not get in my way or thwart me from like trying to pursue those interests but truly we're like serving them up on a platter uh very very grateful uh shout out to mom and dad and pop and my brothers and you know everyone else in the family that was able to make that happen 

INTERVIEWER: i think that's great because it connects back to something you were saying at the beginning about how making sure that you have that attitude of gratitude of of you know not just in this case what you're getting from from fans is through dimension 20 or college humor but having that like modeled and provided for you from early on uh and and what a huge blessing privilege whatever word you want to use like that was to to not have to fight your way out of something to get to the things that you loved and enjoy and find yourself right and and recognizing that and then continuing that gratitude forward that's a very it's very congratulations it's a very healthy approach and uh so cheers and here's to you 

BRENNAN: i'd say you know the congratulations that are due here are to you and everyone else who has like uh had to like knuckle down and get to this hobby and get to their passions through adversity and obstacles you know that i don't feel any congratulations they're due to me although i appreciate the kindness truly like attitude of gratitude is the bare minimum there's i mean i know there are people out there like me who you know would look at a life where every possible thing was teed up for them and be like i got here completely by myself i have a fuckin' i grabbed my bootstraps and lifted my ass straight into the sky baby uh it's the most toxic attitude in the world to have nobody as an island and uh how dare you in fact i'm here because a lot of people uh did uh things that they didn't have to do that directly impacted my ability to have this life and for that i am infinitely great it's really great 

INTERVIEWER: you mentioned redwall um i don't know how active you are on social media but did you know that there is a bot on twitter that just tweets out 

BRENNAN: the greatest twitter account of all time i know exactly what you are talking about redwall feastbot goddamn 

INTERVIEWER: i retweet it every time every time 

BRENNAN: perfect it's a perfect twitter account let's let's see what what are they doing right now everyone read well peace but let's see what's going on hold on let me see here 

INTERVIEWER: will it be strawberry fizz will be a chestnut cheddar wheel 

BRENNAN: i'm betting damsons i'm betting something you know uh uh uh deeper and ever pie here we go red wall feast bot um okay what do we got okay pinned okay most recent three hours ago he stuffed himself with toasted acorn and chestnut scones slices of plum and almond cake cucumber sandwiches a wild garlic pasty and a large tankard of mulled metal ale man 

INTERVIEWER: if that's not the good life i don't really know what it is 

BRENNAN: that is the good life those little furry critters are living it up yeah i loved those red wall books god they were so good 

INTERVIEWER: it's it's one of those things that again like and it is a whole joy having a kid i might we just read the hobbit to her uh this past summer um which now means that every night it's like gandalf tell me a gandalf story and i have to make up stories about how baby gandalf you know played hide and seek with the goblin 

BRENNAN: baby gandalf man you just said i hope amazon is not listening because they're going to grab that be coming this this wall baby gandalf man young hot gandalf what a pitch how about it timothy chalamet is gandalf right incredible 

INTERVIEWER: uh it's a shame amazon is listening because uh those ideas were all stolen they're currently in development already 

BRENNAN: they're spending 2 billion on it they're going to develop their sinking you'd be effects for baby gandalf will rival anything you've ever seen before 

INTERVIEWER: and it'll be beautiful it'll be worth it we'll all watch it then tweet about how disappointed we are uh such as fandom these days i'm curious um what what has been what has been something that uh did you have a moment i don't know the best way to express it do you have a moment where you were like holy cow what we're doing at dimension 20 you're at college humor this is resonating with people like like where did you know was it being recognized somewhere like somebody sending in fan mail just where you were like wait a minute this is a thing this is a real thing it's it's working it's hitting 

BRENNAN: you know i'll let you know when it really hits when it real when i've really processed it i will holler at you no it's it's it's really it's really bizarre i think i think the best the best example i can kind of give in terms in terms of of so i did something short-sighted because because it's there's something really dangerous about looks there's reason really psychically dangerous about uh uh losing anonymity like there's parts of it that are not really good for you and you know i i'm more worried than anything else about that like this may be like a weird new yorkerism but you're always antsy and kind of on tenterhooks about like not letting things go to your head don't get a big head don't let don't let it go to your head kid so i'm like constantly obsessively on that wavelength and i backed myself into a funny corner right where early on in college first year working for college humor i started getting recognized on the street for the first time and people would almost universally be like oh my god tide pod and they'd be talking about the tide pod ceo there goes taipod happened i was out in my like home diner like my diner where i spent countless nights as a as a youth as a teen and i was there with my grandma and my mom and you know i'm trying to explain actual play to my grandmother who lived through world war ii and you know i'm like well it's a it's a board game of the imagination grandma you know anything can happen right and and it's a show and i can see this woman who loves her grandchildren more than anything in the world really put on a face of like i am probably not gonna watch this um and um like like oh brother and a group of teens get up from uh youths themselves haunting the same diner that i had haunted in the halcyon days uh of of yore come over and they they go like hey i just wanted to say like i loved tide pod and you know in front of my my mom and grandma and my cousin was also there and um you know going like it's you know like oh yeah and dimension 20 stuff is so cool like i'm watching dimension 20. it's like dimension 20 only been out for like two two or three months at this point we weren't even done with season one of fantasy high and um i was like oh that's really kind of you and they walk away and my cousin's like so you famous now in the way that any self-respecting cousin must you know like oh so big guy people came up in the diner and they knew who you were uh and i s i said this thing deflecting both to my cousin and also myself internally to not have to process like loss of anonymity what it means to be recognized in public what it means to be in like a childhood safe place but suddenly not not be a stranger anymore and so what i said sort of dismissively is i was like look they still came up and called me tide pod right i was like i am not famous okay when they start calling me bren and lee mulligan that will be different but there you know that's not ever gonna happen and like a year or two ago some someone on this on the street as i was quickly walking by pointed right at me and said oh my god brendan lee mulligan and i went well that's like cats out of the bag cat's out of the bed and it was one of those moments where you like yeah and especially like this last june when when covid numbers were at record lows i had had a mask on for over a year and i hadn't been outside and i didn't know how much more popular the show was getting and i went back home to new york and i walked from uh washington square park uh over to the subway and then in that five blocks i got stopped three times and i went oh no so oh no something different has happened by the way if anyone has ever stopped me don't i'm not don't ever feel that it's always so not everyone who's ever stopped me on the street has been the sweetest and nicest person in the world it's always and it is very cool there's a part of it that's undeniably cool it's always lovely to hear from from someone who's been impacted by your work but the own so the oh no is not directed at being stopped on the street the oh no is directed at the continuing battle to try to have an understanding of who and what you are as a person that's what the oh no is for is like how you relate to yourself but yeah that's so so yes it's been it's been really crazy and it's really hard to describe there are just big pluses and minuses to it again like mostly pluses mostly it's it's great uh mostly it's a great thing um and again like especially our fan base i feel like our shows kind of like the heart of our show our like philosophical core is is clear enough that when i meet people that like the show i'm almost always meeting someone who i'm like oh what a cool person right like the cast and the crew and all the storytellers we've had on the show are such sweethearts and good people that it feels like when we meet when i meet a fan in the wild it's like you know dollars to donuts that they're going to be a solid human being which feels really great um but yeah then you do but it's always a little bit twilight zoney to be in your like you know to be in a coffee shop somewhere and you're sitting there and someone comes up and they're like by the way i really love to escape from the blood keep and you're like i'm pretty sure i like grabbed a thing out of the corner of my nose i'm pretty sure i maybe just grabbed a little boogie out of the corner of my nose and that person saw it and now they're gonna go on twitter and they're going to tell everyone that i pulled a little bug out of the corner of my nose and that's it that's it all that's all she wrote for me you know uh pack it up um um uh it's you know it's so so yeah that that's the that's the weirdness of it all but it's yeah you're right to ask what it's like it's really surreal it's surreal in a way that it's really hard to communicate 

INTERVIEWER: before we wrap up i i would be remiss if i did not ask uh a burning question is being on game changer and um actually as much fun as it looks or is it all a deep lie and facade or is it the perpetual joy that it appears to be? 

BRENNAN: it's very very fun it's very very very fun um i i love being on those shows it's a joy sam and trap do such a good job of putting those shows together um i feel like i backed myself into a corner with this like hyper competitive persona on those shows um which is partially based in truth but maybe not a whole hundred percent true but i do love it it's very um i i just love those people just nice any time i go up to the shows it's always nice to be doing like my favorite part of them actually is doing bits on the couch with everybody my favorite part of uh game changer likewise is like figuring out the fun of the game um the points always stress me out i know that i seem to love points but there's a reason that my show the one that i run doesn't have points and there's no winners i like i like cooperation more than i like competition but it is very joyful to be on game changer and on actually 

INTERVIEWER: it's one of those things like especially um and this is just pure fan andrew at this point but uh a very recent episode of game changer last couple of weeks was just a love letter to um and of course now i feel terrible because i don't remember her name yes yeah where it was just everything was just a pouring of love onto her from friends and family and i thought what a cool thing to be able to do especially i assume because you're not beholden to a network or you know someone who's saying like hey got eight episodes i gotta do this um just being able to say hey let's take the creative energy we have and express love for somebody who deserves it and and just what a fantastic thing and i would assume what a gratifying thing to be a part of or be it a place that allows or enables that i would assume 

BRENNAN: first of all jess ross is one of the most incredible human beings in the world and absolutely deserves every piece of love that she can receive yeah it's very special and i think too it's sort of fun you know that's always one of the things with dropout too and college humor is like sort of the depth of lore the fact that like it's not a secret who we are right like like who we are as people in the relationships we have to each other are embellished and embossed for the purposes of the camera but like there is something very special there to be able to to connect to these people and ha and share a little bit of their their personality within the like the lore of the college humor universe um it's very special that sam gets to do that now we could dig into the fact that you know in the history of game changer there have been two episodes that kind of did a deep dive on one of the contestants and jess ross got a bunch of love letters from her family and the other one was me getting tortured with a game i couldn't win and why maybe that is the choice that sam made maybe sam you want to give me a call and tell me why why i got that one why couldn't i get a nice letter you know but 

INTERVIEWER: maybe maybe that was your love letter maybe your perspective is what's wrong maybe you're the problem let's just let's just gaslight you a little bit maybe it's your fault 

BRENNAN: you know what andrew good point i think i AM the problem now that you mention it i think i'm pretty much the problem that's a good point 

INTERVIEWER: um that no i love everything that y'all are doing over there it's such it is one of the few it might be the only non-netflix thing that i pay for right i'm like that is that's content that is joyful and worth consuming and i encourage anyone listening uh to go do so as well they run sales with ridiculous title discount codes so go check it out um but just you know to be one of the people to say to you hey what you guys do matter and it's joyful and uh inspires people and so we are glad to help pay for your burrito um because it's absolutely worth it 

BRENNAN: man that's kind of good to say it's very special you know we're uh we're releasing right now the the latest season of dimension 20 that we're doing is called a star struck odyssey and it's an adaptation of my mom's sci-fi space opera graphic novel series so to work to work at a company like dropout where i can go to the company and say hey for our actual play show i'd like to do an 18 episode season set in my mother's comic book universe can we license it from her and make that happen and the response is a unanimous resounding hell yes yeah it's incredible uh it's really incredible and and everything in my life came together like my mom who put d d into my hands and the world she created like her magnum opus this incredible unique brilliant uh science fiction galaxy world building and to take that and bring it to dropout and then have all of my friends and loved ones that i work on the show with and create to me i think arguably the best season of the show we've ever done uh has been really significant it's so so meaningful yeah so it's there's a lot of awesome stuff coming uh up at dropout and yeah there it is very magical to be able to have that touch of the personal and the meaningful within the stuff that we do 

INTERVIEWER: that's awesome dude um well we'll wrap up here in a minute but i want to remind people for those of you who are listening for the first time maybe you've listened 100 times which would be interesting because we only have like 80 episodes but you know tip of the hat to you time traveler um if you have listened you know that you can support the show at patreon.com roll for persuasion and doing so gets you access to a very fun little thing i like to call the zone of truth um why because that's what i called it the first time i did it and i'm stuck with it branding but the zone of truth is a beautiful little bonus segment that i do with my guests after each and every episode where we talk about a subject that we make up on the fly i like to pitch to people like this if you were at a party and maybe you'd been drinking a little bit or partaking of some sort of substance that relaxes you somewhat whatever that might be for you and you had the opportunity somebody sat down with you was like man i just want to hear what you were really excited about and into and you had that subject that you could just riff on for forever because you're like look battlestar galactica let me tell you right like it's that that dwight schrute-esque level of love i'd like to ask people what would that thing be and and i like to point out that we have had i mean we've had everything from people who like to work on muscle cars who like to train dogs to fetch tennis balls in a competitive manner margaret weiss author of dragon lance is a dog trainer don't know if you know this i found out about it on this segment so that's the kind of stuff we like to talk about so i'm curious brennan what is your fun obsessive hobby or love that you'd like to spend 10 15 minutes uh educating me on 

BRENNAN: yo estudio espanol cada dia, y es mi actatura favorita, creo que es mas importante para hablar dos idiomas o mas. [Music] that's probably a butchered butchered sense i apologize for my terrible spanish but i've been studying spanish during the pandemic i used to be fluent-ish when i was itty-bitty i grew up when i was until i was four years old in washington heights and i could speak spanish and english kind of similarly well uh but i've been studying it a lot a lot um and uh i am obsessed i i really i'm at a place now where like everything i just said i never speak with anybody in spanish that's just from studying vocabulary and grammar and uh you know i i need to be able to speak with people more to actually get to a point of fluency but um i i love it it's like a real joy i think that number one if you live in america there's almost it is really important to be able to speak spanish it's such a widely spoken language here um and it is so it's it's like you know there's a million situations where stuff can come up i remember you know like you know whether you're yeah it's just really i think it's really worthwhile it's really beneficial to be able to be another language and it also makes you appreciate your first language more to speak a second language and it also like it gives you an appreciation for if you've ever spoken to someone who is esl who speaks english as a second language it makes you appreciate all these things like the fact that most of the time that someone is speaking english as a second language and there's something that they're not getting correct in their grammar it's not just it's it's you it's i haven't found like oh that's because you're actually using the correct grammar from your first language and it's really it's like it's so fascinating and it tells you so much about people and humanity and you you you learn to think in new ways about other things that that language is maybe better at like second languages like has ways of expressing that your language doesn't have uh and then it makes you appreciate the weird little idiosyncrasies and foibles of your own first language you go like why do we do it that way the way this other language does it seems to work a lot better 

INTERVIEWER: i love that and i'm very curious about what your approach to uh to learning especially during the pandemic has been and and so again if you support the show patreon to come such role for persuasion we're about to dive into that whole topic so if you're a patreon listener just keep listening it'll come up in a second if you're not consider it it could be kind of fun but i want to say thank you to brennan for being on the show we'll record that bit in just a moment but where can people find you if you want to be found if you don't want to be found where can people go to look where you're not uh on the internet 

BRENNAN: if you want to find me you should go to dropout.tv where you can watch all of dimension 20. um you can also if you want to check out our shows and see if it's to taste you can go to youtube.com dimension20 show we got a bunch of free seasons up there and uh you can also uh find me personally at brennan l m on twitter and then at brennan lee mulligan on instagram those are the places that you can find um if you do not want to find me then i would say go deep into the forests behind your home wander there for three days and three nights on the dawning of the fourth day a white hind will appear to you and lead you to a cool glade with a spring of fresh water there you will not find me i got kicked out of that glade and i'm not allowed back 

INTERVIEWER: they have very strict security there it's very unfortunate they keep it locked down in that clade for sure but it's good i mean you got to have standards so you do yeah absolutely thank you so much man it's been such a pleasure looking forward to hearing a bit more about spanish here in a moment uh for many reasons which i'm excited to dive into um but first and foremost thank you to you the listeners for listening to the show you can find follow me rolepersuation.com rollpersuasion on twitter and instagram and myspace i guess i don't know go check him out maybe you'll find me there i don't know but thank you for listening to the show please be sure to leave a rating if you are on spotify or apple podcast i very much appreciate it and until next time y'all enjoy your games [Music] you
